The following steps are required on a development host after checking out the repository: 
1. Run 'npm install' (initializes any node.js packages, i.e., Bootstrap)
1. Run make (performs any compilation steps required after code changes, i.e., sass files)
1. Create python virtual environment (e.g., 'python3 -m venv venv')
1. Switch into virtual environment (e.g., 'source venv/bin/activate')
1. Install pip requirements ('pip install -r requirements.txt')
1. Change into app directory
1. Launch gunicorn (gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 wsgi:app)
